# Build Error 2: Unfree License Issue

## Problem
Build failed with error:
```
error: Package 'vscode-1.103.2' has an unfree license ('unfree'), refusing to evaluate.
```

## Root Cause
VSCode has an unfree license and Nix refuses to build it by default. Need to explicitly allow unfree packages.

## Steps Taken
1. Identified that vscode package requires unfree license acceptance
2. Need to configure nixpkgs to allow unfree packages in the flake.nix
3. Will update flake.nix to include allowUnfree configuration

## Resolution
Update flake.nix to allow unfree packages by configuring nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true.
