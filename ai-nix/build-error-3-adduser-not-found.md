# Build Error 3: adduser Command Not Found

## Problem
Build failed with error:
```
/bin/sh: line 1: adduser: command not found
```

## Root Cause
The nixos/nix base image doesn't include the `adduser` command. NixOS uses different user management tools.

## Steps Taken
1. Identified that adduser is not available in the NixOS base image
2. Need to use NixOS-specific user creation method or install shadow package
3. Will update Dockerfile to use appropriate user creation method for NixOS

## Resolution
Update Dockerfile to use NixOS-compatible user creation or remove user creation step since distrobox handles this.
