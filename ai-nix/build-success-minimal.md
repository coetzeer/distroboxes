# Build Success: Minimal AI-Nix Image

## Success Message
```
Successfully built 154037c154b5
Successfully tagged db-ai-nix:latest
```

## Solution Applied
Created a minimal flake.nix with only essential tools:
- Core utilities (curl, wget, git)
- gemini-cli and qwen-code from nix-ai-tools

The build succeeded after removing problematic packages like VSCode that had hash mismatches.

## Next Steps
Will now create a full version excluding the problematic VSCode package.
