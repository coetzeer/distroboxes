# Build Success Summary

## Final Result
âœ… **Build completed successfully!**

Container `db-ai-nix` was built successfully after addressing the following issues:

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Podman Not Found
- **Problem**: `podman` command not available
- **Solution**: Used `docker` as alternative

### 2. Unfree License Error  
- **Problem**: VSCode has unfree license, Nix refused to build
- **Solution**: Updated flake.nix to allow unfree packages with `allowUnfree = true`

### 3. User Creation Error
- **Problem**: `adduser` command not found in NixOS base image
- **Solution**: Removed user creation from Dockerfile (distrobox handles this)

### 4. Pip Externally Managed Environment
- **Problem**: Pip install failed due to Nix's immutable filesystem
- **Solution**: Removed pip install from shellHook

## Final Configuration
- Base image: `nixos/nix:latest`
- Native packages: neovim, tmux, zsh, nano, zellij, vscode, git, curl, wget, unzip, python3, nodejs
- Unfree packages allowed
- Clean shellHook with just PATH export
- No user creation (handled by distrobox)

## Build Command Used
```bash
docker build . -t db-ai-nix
```

The container is now ready for use with distrobox.
