# Build Success: Final AI-Nix Image

## Success Message
```
Successfully built 95ccc2d1acda
Successfully tagged db-ai-nix:latest
```

## Final Solution
Successfully built the ai-nix container with:
- Core utilities (curl, wget, unzip, git)
- Development tools (neovim, tmux, zsh, nano, zellij)
- Programming languages (python3, nodejs, npm)
- AI CLI tools (gemini-cli, qwen-code)

## Issues Resolved
1. **Podman not found**: Used docker instead
2. **Unlocked flake reference**: Added `--impure` flag
3. **VSCode hash mismatch**: Excluded VSCode from the build
4. **Multiple dependency issues**: Resolved by using minimal then expanding to full build

## Build Command Used
```bash
docker build . -t db-ai-nix
```

The image is now ready for use with distrobox.
