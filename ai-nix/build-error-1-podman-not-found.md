# Build Error 1: Podman Not Found

## Problem
Command `podman build . -t db-ai-nix` failed with error:
```
bash: line 1: podman: command not found
```

## Root Cause
Podman is not installed or not available in the current environment.

## Steps Taken
1. Identified that podman command is missing from the system
2. Need to either:
   - Install podman
   - Use docker instead if available
   - Use alternative container build method

## Resolution
Will attempt to use docker as alternative or install podman if possible.
